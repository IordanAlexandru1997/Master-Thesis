Need to manually create the class before creating the vertex.  Also, the class V is by default the vertice class which is a superclass
The issue here is that OrientDB does not support MERGE directly as Neo4j does. You have to manually check if the vertex or edge exists before creation.

orientdb init commands: create class SoBO extends V;

very big known problem with delete function. the internal db caching mechanism does not work properly when given calls therefore does not fully delete records.
