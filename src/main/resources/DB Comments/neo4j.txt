In Neo4j, you typically interact with the database through Cypher queries. The native Java driver doesn't offer a direct object mapping like you have with OrientDB's OVertex, where you can directly manipulate vertices and edges as objects.

The snippet you provided for OrientDB takes advantage of OrientDB's native object handling, allowing you to fetch, update, and save vertices as if they were regular Java objects.

With Neo4j, the typical approach would involve writing a Cypher query to update the specific property of a node, as I previously provided in the update method for Neo4j. It's a more declarative approach, relying on the Cypher query language to specify what you want to be done, rather than manipulating objects directly.
